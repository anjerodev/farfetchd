## Features

- **AI-powered body creation**: Create the body of your request with ease using Farfetchd's AI integration powered by [Ollama](https://ollamalab.com/). There's no need to write JSON or form-data by hand.
- **Cross-platform usage**: Use Farfetchd directly from your browser, no need for a specific operating system.
- **Easy to use**: Farfetchd is designed to be simple and intuitive for simple APIs testing.
- **CORS issue solver**: Farfetchd comes with a built-in CORS issue solver. Use the [Farfetchd Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/farfetchd-cors/bciihlhnemeblkgknnmfnflllegibgfo?authuser=0&hl=es) to bypass the CORS issue when testing APIs locally.
- **Light and Dark theme**: Are you in the dark side? Or are you in the light side? Automatically theme base on your system theme configuration.

## AI Configuration Instructions

Download Ollama from the official website. Once installed, open the terminal and run the command `ollama pull llama3.1`, which will download the basic llama3.1 model on your machine. Once the download is complete:

- In local: You can now use AI generation.
- In the web: You need to add "https://farfetchd.anjero.dev" to the Ollama environment variables `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` to avoid the CORS error, as explained in [How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-allow-additional-web-origins-to-access-ollama).

## Run in local
